# Geo-Locked NFTs

Geo-Locked NFTs do exact;y what they sound like, they are geo-restricted and user can only mint them in specific location, as decided by owner of NFT. 

## How Is It Possible?

Using FHE i.e Homomorphic Encryption we can send user's encrypted location freely on-chain which was the only barrier previously stopping us from implementing this.

The project "Geo Locked NFT" depicts one of many use cases that FHE unlocks in web3.
